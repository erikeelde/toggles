# Toggles - feature switching

Store app settings / feature toggles in an external application making in persist across clean data / reinstalls.

## Previously known as wrench
Wrench can be downloaded on [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.izettle.wrench).
and it's sources are on [github](https://github.com/iZettle/wrench)
I made wrench while employed at izettle and to be able to continue to provide updates I unfortunately
needed to rerelease the application.

## Toggles app

I will release toggles to play store as soon as I find the time to and will then provide a download link for it.

My plan is to make toggles backwards compatible with the libraries provided by wrench.

Stores the settings / toggles behind a content provider.

This is a development tools meant to facilitate feature switching in an external app so that configurations
will be retained across clear data / uninstalls.

It is based on a ContentProvider.
